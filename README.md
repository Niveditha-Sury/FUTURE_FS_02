## **Getting Started**

 **Prerequisites**

To run this project, you need to have the following installed on your machine:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (recommended version 14 or higher)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

 **Installation**

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
2.  Install dependencies for both the client and server:
    ```bash
    # Install server dependencies
    npm install

    # Navigate to the client directory and install dependencies
    cd client
    npm install
    ```

 **Usage**

1.  Start the MongoDB service.
2.  In the root directory, start the server:

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
